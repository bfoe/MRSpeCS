yet another version:
====================

this one includes segmentation with a priori probability maps
used both as initialization and throughout the segmentation process

Why: for comparison with SPM which works that way

OBS: the standard space FSL probability maps are in
     /usr/local/fsl/data/standard/tissuepriors/
     for windows version copy the 6 files to the script dir
